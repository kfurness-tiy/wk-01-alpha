    <h1>Mythical Creatures</h1>
    <h3>Creatures that are fantasy but should be real</h3>

    <h2>The Dragon</h2>
    <p>
      The dragon is known to be one of the most fierce mythical creatures out there! But do not fear, not all dragons are viscous fire-breathing monsters whose goal is to torch your village and/or eat you. There are friendly dragons, too. Ever heard of Puff the Magic Dragon?

    <h2>The Griffin</h2>
    <p>
      The griffin is not only known for being <a href="https://www.westminstercollege.edu/Westminster"> College's mascot</a>, it is also known for being half an eagle and half a lion. Nope, I'm not lion... (bad pun). It has the head and wings of an eagle, but with the powerful behind, hind legs, and adorable tail of a lion.
