    <h2>The Dragon</h2>
    <p>
      The dragon is known to be one of the most fierce mythical creatures out there! But do not fear, not all dragons are viscous fire-breathing monsters whose goal is to torch your village and/or eat you. There are friendly dragons, too. Ever heard of Puff the Magic Dragon?
